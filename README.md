# Hold-em-Odd-Calculator
The aim of this program is to calculate the odds of what you can hit (pair, two pair, three of a kind etc.) given the cards that are on the table (The flop, the turn and the river) and your hand. 

The first draft of the program will be a system input and output of what is possible to achieve given your hand.

This code is to be writen in Python to learn a new coding language.
